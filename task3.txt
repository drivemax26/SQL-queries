Select all user dialogs with ID = 12345
SELECT * 
FROM x27_social_dialogs 
WHERE id_user_from = 12345 OR id_user_to = 12345;


Select all dialogs of the user with ID = 12345 for the last week where there are new messages

SELECT * 
FROM x27_social_dialogs 
WHERE (id_user_from = 12345 OR id_user_to = 12345) 
AND has_new_msg = 1 
AND date_created >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 WEEK);


Count the number of all user dialogs with ID = 12345

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_dialogs
FROM x27_social_dialogs 
WHERE id_user_from = 12345 OR id_user_to = 12345;


Select 10 users with more than 10 dialogs

SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS total_dialogs
FROM (
    SELECT id_user_to AS user_id FROM skelar.x27_social_dialogs
    UNION ALL
    SELECT id_user_from AS user_id FROM skelar.x27_social_dialogs
) AS all_users
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING total_dialogs >= 10
ORDER BY total_dialogs DESC
LIMIT 10;


Select the top 10 users by the number of divlogs

SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS total_dialogs
FROM (
    SELECT id_user_to AS user_id FROM skelar.x27_social_dialogs
    UNION ALL
    SELECT id_user_from AS user_id FROM skelar.x27_social_dialogs
